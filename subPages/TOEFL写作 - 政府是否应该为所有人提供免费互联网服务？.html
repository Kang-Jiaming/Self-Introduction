    <p class="blog-heading">Should Government Make Internet Access to All the Citizens at No Cost?</p>
    
    <p class="blog-content">
      Whether government should make Internet access to all the citizens at no cost has been a controversial topic among the public these days. Some advocate that the government should provide free Internet service since the Internet is as important as other services such as building roads. Yet, I hold the opposite opinion that the government should not make Internet access to all the citizens at no cost.
      <br><br>
      Initially, free Internet can lead to vast amount of users and causing Internet jams. A sudden increase of clients on the Internet will cram the servers since Internet access is now free of charge. This eliminates the necessary connection such as online education, remote medical service, or even emergency services. Besides, this could result in a dramatically low Internet speed and make thousands of websites collapse. For example, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the growth of Internet users since they are asked to stay at home. However, the ISP(Internet Service Provider) in Europe could not hold the colossal network traffics, so some online streaming websites have to announce that they need to reduce the streaming quality to 720P to provide available internet connection for everyone. Accordingly, we can see that even only the Internet users increased a small amount, it causes difficulty for the ISP.  And the situation will definitely be much more severe if large users comes in due to the Internet is free.
      <br><br>
      Secondly, providing free Internet can cause Internet abuse. The reason why people now save their cellular data, like avoiding downloading large files outside, is that that the data in their data plan is limited, and they will be charged if they exceed their cellular data plan. However, if people can access the Internet freely, they will consume a huge amount of data without concern. Even the number of clients stays the same, the Internet traffic still overloads. Take myself as an example. Last year during the pandemic period, our community provided free Internet service for the households in order to let students take online classes. However, many non-student users also use this free network, and they download Blu-ray movies or games that cost a lot of data, leading to the network fluctuation for students like us. We experienced a severe lag when we had online classes, and this lag has been solved after the community set a password for that network. So the free network will result in people abusing the network, and interfere with those normal users.
      <br><br>
      Thirdly, if the government allows citizens to use the free Internet, it reduces the budget on other necessity services such as compulsory education, or medical insurance. People may not experience the benefits from those areas if the government puts all of its funding on the costly free Internet. 
      <br><br>
      Although in this day and age, the Internet may be as important as other services such as building roads, since a lot of activity is needed to be done online. However, people in the past 30 years or 50 years never experienced the Internet, and they still enjoyed the convenience from the traditional telephone, newspaper, or radios. And these things are still not outdated today. Losing the availability of the Internet only suppresses some Internet-based services such as Uber. But nowadays, people are still able to call a taxi in the traditional way.
      <br><br>
      All in all, from various dimensions, we can see that the government should not make Internet access to all citizens at no cost.
