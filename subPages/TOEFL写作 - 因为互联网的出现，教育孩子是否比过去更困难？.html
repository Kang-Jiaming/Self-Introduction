    <p class="blog-content">
      Whether educating children is a more difficult task today than it was in the past because they spend so much time on cellphones, online games, and social networking websites has been a controversial topic among the public these days. Some advocate that those platforms benefits them, while I hold the opposite opinion that educating children is more difficult today due to these services.
      <br><br>
      To begin with, cell phones, online games, and social networking websites create a disturbance on children. To put it more explicitly, children can easily get distracted by these services when they are trying to learn, since they attract children more than classwork, as there are more interesting types of entertainment on the internet for a those students who are not quite interested in plain knowledge eg. tv&computer have appealing color, music and graphics that makes children easily distracted. So when they are studying, they are more likely to recall the story, music, images in the game, and lost attention to the class. Since they are likely to refuse learning from textbooks, it would be more difficult to educate the children. Back in the past, there were no such entertainment services as appealing as today.  Magazines, TV shows, albums, were not likely to disturb student much like today, and it would be  easier for them to balance between entertainment and study.They have formed a dependency on these services since they have used them for a long time. For example, many classmates, including me, would unconsciously check our inboxes, newsletters, etc. during the class when we are trying to reach some class material on our devices. For the reason that we had established a connection between our device and these services, and the first thing when we turn on the screen is to check these stuff. Consequently, we would involuntarily access them on during learning period, and easily get distracted. In a more seriously circumstance, some student would even surf the internet consciously because they don’t want to pay attention to class. From the example, we can see that such internet services like social networking websites do disturb students on the learning process, thus increase the difficulty to educate them.
      <br><br>
      Secondly, contents on social networking websites, online games may influence children’s literal or mental concept. Due to the marvelous advanced online platforms, a number of internet-slang words appears. Children’s mind are likely to be infused with such expressions, hence revealing an effectiveness decrease in literal thinking. Take my cousin for instance. He likes to surf on the internet, and he was quite interested in internet slang words such as “cu”(see you) “ty”(thank you). He even writes these words in his school assignment, which is literally inappropriate. Such words create a disturbance with the standard English words, and he should not get access to such slang words at an early age, because this is the crucial learning period of standard English for him. Also, children love to imitiate and usually lack of ability to differentiate right or wrong. Accordingly, they would think that those slang words are a fashion way, and use them without considering the proper circumstances. From the example, we can see that the infusion of internet-slang words poses a difficulty to educate children. In stark contrast, there was no internet in the past, so children would not get such slang usage. All their English usages are from standardized textbooks, dictionaries, audio tapes, news, etc. Such language inputs are more formal to them than today, thus contributing to their language learning.
      <br><br>
      Admittedly, these services has various useful information for children’s learning. For example, they can use cell phones to look up words quickly, or practice math skills in games like sudoku. But these resources can also be achieved in paper form easily. There are more elaborate and comprehensive resources in library, designed specifically for educating the children. And since they are too young to control themselves from being distracted by online services, it is better to use online services less frequently. 
      <br><br>
      All in all, from various dimensions, we can see that educating children is a more difficult task today than it was in the past because they spend so much time on cell phones, online games, and social networking websites.
